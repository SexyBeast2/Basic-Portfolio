                The titular name of this page is in reference to the creator of the page, myself. I am a Nicaraguan-Serb 
                and essentially come down from a line of war babies with a pallate that has evolutionarily adapted to only recognize 
                three tastes: meat, bread, and blood. I only make my meal choices based on their macronutritional values and 
                for the longest time I used to think gourmet was a word used to describe experimental film genres. I used to tell
                people that I thought Hal Hartley was way more gourmet than David Lynch.

            Because of my inherited body-mind composition people have assumed me and my family as being simple minded. However, 
            I just think we're incredibly efficient and in spite of the wider breadth of cultural perspective that has winnowed 
            from the war-torn skies of my two countries into my head, my brain refuses to retain any block of useless information.
            This is why Serbia has more monasteries than libraries - we're always looking at the bigger picture. Thus, I believe
            existence precedes essence, and I only engage with what I love, including coding, basketball, and acronyms that 
            define my system of beliefs such as <strong>D.E.S.T.I.N.Y.</strong> (Digest, Eat, Sex To Immortalize Nicaragua and Yugoslavia).
